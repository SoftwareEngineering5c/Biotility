# Intro

This ReadME will give a brief description on our groups project for Biotility. 
Biotility at University of Florida CERHB is committed to providing high-quality education and training to facilitate the professional growth of each participant. Our short-courses are attended by professionals, students preparing to enter industry careers, and researchers, all of whom seek to expand and deepen their knowledge in technical and regulatory details unique to biotechnology industries and translational research. The Biotechnician Assistant Credentialing Exam (BACE) is an industry-recognized exam designed to assess core skills and knowledge sets identified by industry, and represented within the academic and performance standards of Florida’s secondary Biotechnology program. The test has been vetted by the state’s industry organization BioFlorida, representing representing more than 3,000 companies and research organizations in the biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and bioagriculture sectors. 


The webapp provides a hands-on way for students and teachers to interact by allowing students to sign up for courses, take quizzes, and practice for the BACE.

## How to run the project locally  
     
In order to run the project locally please follow the following steps:
Running on Mac/iOS:
- 1. npm install -g bower
- 2. npm install -g grunt-cli
- 3. npm install -g yo
- 4. npm install -g-generator-meanjs
- 5. git clone the repo: https://github.com/SoftwareEngineering5c/Biotility.git
- 6. cd on terminal to the repo (Biotility)
- 7. npm install 
- 8. grunt
     
The terminal should now output:
 Biotility - Development Environment
    Environment:			development
    Port:				3000
    Database:				mongodb://devteam:devteam@ds027769.mongolab.com:27769/software5c
    App version:			0.4.1
    MEAN.JS version:			0.4.1

## How to update database and server connections  
Everytime a user signs up the database is automatically updated.  
When a user goes to their profile page, they can edit their profile info.  
Database is automically updated as well with quiz results when a student takes a quiz.  
     
The user schema is defined in:  
*Biotility/modules/users/server/models/user.server.model.js*  
The quiz question schema is defined in:  
*Biotility/modules/quiz/server/models/quizQuestion.server.model.js*  
     
Database connection:   
mongodb://devteam:devteam@ds027769.mongolab.com:27769/software5c'  
      
To change the connection go to:  
*/Biotility/config/env/production.js*  
and input the new connection, along with the correct credentials
